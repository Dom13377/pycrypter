Installation:

1. Install Python https://www.python.org
2. Navigate to this current directory
3. pip3 install -r requirements.txt
4. python3 main.py

Usage:

This program takes an input file of choice and encrypts/encodes it to be undetectable by any AV through static analysis. All you have to do is run the program, type the module of choice, enter the file path, and it will automatically create a FUD python script. 

If you would like buy me a coffee
